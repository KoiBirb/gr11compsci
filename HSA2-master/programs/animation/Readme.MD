# HOW TO WRITE AN ANIMATION GAME

This is a tutorial to demonstrate how to make a moderately good animation game using HSA2 graphics so that you don't have to learn Java Swing Graphics first.
We'll be making a block breaking game that's flexible enough to be extended as you wish.

**Controls:** the keyboard arrow keys will be controlling the paddle, but there is code also so that it can be controlled by the mouse.

## EXTENSIONS when done

There are lots of possibilities for you to expand on this.

* Make this game a lot more fun by having different types of Blocks (see the block class). When you hit a special block, the game changes somehow.
* You could make more than one level
* You could change this to be a Space Invaders game without too much trouble.
 * Change the paddle to a space ship
 * Remove the ball
 * Make the blocks move back and forth and down (You'll probably need a separate timer for this)
 * Add bullets/lasers from your space ship when you press <SPACE>
 * Have the aliens drop bomb onto you
