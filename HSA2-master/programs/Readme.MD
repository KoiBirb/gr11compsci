# Sample programs using HSA2

:one: Copy and run HSB_colours.java
   (HSB stands for the colour model Hue-Saturation-Brightness)

:two: Go into the folder :small_blue_diamond:first_program:small_blue_diamond: and read the PDF there. Follow the instructions and you should end up with a nice program called Fading.java

:three: Work through the 5 steps in the "Animation Tutorial" programs (:small_blue_diamond:animation:small_blue_diamond: folder). We're making a block breaking game.

:four: Have a look at the three sample programs that grade 11 students wrote. Try them out.
